mtcars is a dataset describing the features of automobiles from an old magazine. It has 7 variables.
```{r}
mtcars

# three ways to subset
# mtcars["mpg"] # keep in dataframe
# mtcars[["mpg"]] # take out of dataframe
# mtcars$mpg # take out of dataframe  # same as above

mtcars["mpg"]
mtcars[["mpg"]]
mtcars$mpg

mean(mtcars[["mpg"]])

```
The mean difference was `r mean(mtcars$mpg)`.

```{r}
mtcars[["cyl"]]
```

```{r}
unique(mtcars[["cyl"]])
```
